I very much enjoyed the exercise. Sometimes it was hard to figure out, what the actual task was or what you want from us, 
but this also left a lot of room to look into different stuff, which I kind of liked. I spent (especially the last two weeks)
a lot of time on the project, although overall, if I had started earlier, it's an okayish time pensum. Very roughly estimated
maybe 60 hours for me (2 Weeks * 4 hours) or something (but I didnt have a logbook, read this one now, before submitting. Will
keep it in mind though)
