This repository contains my two projects from my quantum computing and quantum machine learning course at UIO during my Erasmus exchange.

The first project deals with the implementation of the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm with qiskit to find eigenvalues of simple hamiltonians.

The second project is a from scratch implementation of the quantum fouriere transform and the phase estimation algorithm.
