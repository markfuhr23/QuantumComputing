Hi,

I enjoyed this project much more than the first one. I really liked implementing it from scratch and not using qiskit, because of its documentation.
I am sorry again, that it took me longer than expected, but my schedule in june was just too full. The report may appear short, but this time there was not a lot to plot or to write and much more time went into actual coding. I sticked a little bit to the described project 2 scope, but did not really follow all the tasks and looked into what interested me.

This time I spend much more commenting and describing my code. It is definitely not perfect, but with a 30% effort and 80% (80%/95% now worth it) success kind of approach when
cleaning it up I am satisfied.

I am aware that some functions have overlapping functionalities, but because of lack of time I didn't fix that. A note for my report is, that I tried to stick to some
academic languag as much as possible, but sometimes it was just easier to use "I" and express it in a colloquial form, to explain it.



The important files containing my results are:
- utils.py: containing all the functions for QFT, MatrixDFT
- PEutils.py: Containing all functinos for PE
- TestingQFT: Notebook testing my QFT algorithm and comparing it to qiskits QFT
- TestingPE: Notebook testing the PE and printing out loads of steps inbetween, to check functions on functionality
- FTExamples.ipynb: Short example on what FT does
